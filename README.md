This is an Open Street Map app for the Nokia 81104G

### Features
+ Map
+ Send your position by sms
+ Import Tracks (geoJson)

If you want to use the openweathermap, you need to get an API key from openweathermap.org. Then you need to create a file called osm-map.json please check my example [file](/osm-map.json)

For Nokia8110 user -> It is possible with closed slider that the app runs :-)
Settings -> screenlock disable
